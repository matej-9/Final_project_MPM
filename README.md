# Final Project - Online shop website
This was our final project - Online shop website with authentication, cart, contact page and Sign Up/Login. It was great learning experience
to learn GIT and developement in team as well as workflow for tech used. 


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, HTML, DjangoREST framework, MySQL, Javascript

For this project we used Django framework for backend and HTML/CSS & little bit of Javascript for frontend.

## How It Works:

Run migrations to create our DB models.
After running the server we can login as admin -> then we have all permissions to CRUD operations for our products/users.
At the contact page we are sending e-mails only to terminal as in developement phase.
After Sign Up we can choose products and we can proceed to cart for payment.

## Lessons Learned:

It was great project to learn Django backend as it provides lot of functionality out of the box, team developement in GIT /resolving merges & conflicts/ and overall logic of the website developement.
